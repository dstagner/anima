# Anima - uniquely identify a server

Servers in the cloud can be hard to track, and harder to identify uniquely. Hostnames and IP addresses are totally unreliable. 
MAC addresses fail if the server is moved to new hardware. 

The purpose of the Anima library is to provide a reliable, unique ID that can be used to track servers in the cloud.
